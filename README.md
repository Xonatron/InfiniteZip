# InfiniteZip
Creates a zip file of a zip file of a zip file of a zip file of a zip file of a zip file... forever.

## Usage:
To create infinite.zip -- an "infinite" zip file:
- run infinitezip.bat
- in runs forever...
- cancel manually, whenever you wish
- output is found inside automatically created "output" folder
- each numbered folder (2, 3, 4, ...) contains a .ZIP file with that many .ZIP files (including the .ZIP file itself)
  - (For now, there is no "1" folder as this .ZIP is not saved.)
- p.s. within the "output" folder, you may delete the "temp" folder; it contains temporary working files.
